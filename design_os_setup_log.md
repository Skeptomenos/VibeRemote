# Design OS Setup for VibeRemote

## Installation Status
*   **Repo Cloned**: `VibeRemote/design-os`
*   **Dependencies**: Installed (`npm install`)
*   **Build**: Completed (`npm run build`)
*   **Deployed**: Build artifacts copied to `VibeRemote/` root.

## Next Steps
According to Design OS methodology, we should now populate the system with our specific project data.

1.  **Configure**: We need to update `src/data` (if it exists) or the relevant config files to reflect **AgentOS / VibeRemote**.
2.  **Migrate**: Move our existing markdown files (`01_Empathize_Define.md`, etc.) into the Design OS structure if applicable.

(Waiting for user direction on how strictly to follow the Design OS internal structure vs just using it as a dashboard).
